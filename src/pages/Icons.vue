                 Data development and sharing is the driving force for the development of the data industry and the oil and power source of the future world. Nowadays, the data is stored in a unilateral private data center, where the model obtained and analyzed by the demand side has been proved to have big drawbacks, lack of transactional transparency and without guaranteed data ownership and control right. Our ultimate idea is to promote data sharing and achieve common benefit by the distinct QoS storage of all types of data that can be validated publicly and validated anonymously through the Lambda that can be

                At present, many data are owned by all human beings, thereby needing a data infrastructure to enable such shared data access and transaction as medical, education, transportation, energy, agriculture, weather, hydrology, infrastructure, scientific research, public safety data etc. These public data, which are common to all humans, can be distributed, verifiable, stored, analyzed, traded, and used on the Lambda platform.

               The advent of the era of big data brings about tremendous challenges to the ownership of personal privacy data. Usually, data collectors have unlimited right to interpret and use data. With the implementation of GDPR and other bills, the contradiction between data privacy among individuals, enterprises and governments is becoming more acute. Lambda provides reliable, secure and privacy-protected data storage and access capability by means of differential privacy, data encryption and signing, identity authentication and access control, and encrypted transmission.

              So far, many decentralized application projects face the risk of failing to implement, one of the main causes being the shortage of data storage infrastructures. In fact, the essence of an application, centralized or decentralized, is the implementation of business logic, interface display, and user interaction around data access. Therefore, data infrastructure is the core issue of blockchain and decentralized applications. Currently, blockchain ledgers are not suitable for business data storage, IPFS cannot store formatted program access data. While Lambda project provides infinitely scalable decentralized data collection, storage, and access capabilities through elegant chain library decoupling, isomorphic function subchain design, and publicly verifiable data ownership proofs.

             The IoT data are massive, time-series, and simple structured, whose generation process can ensure the authenticity of the data. The IoT data occupy a large amount of storage space, and the value of individual data is small. It needs a lasting work and substantial storage and computing resources to extract value from the data. Lambda's digital currency can measure the value of small data, motivating people to share and contribute computing storage resources to obtain token incentives. Lambda provides a system of data collection, data transmission, data storage, data computing and data transaction in the field of IoT. With this system, data collected by sensors such as satellite remote sensing data, hydrological data and atmospheric data can be calculated in different dimensions and sold to anyone and institutions that need it through smart contracts.

            n the field of artificial intelligence, the current consensus is that the role of data is many times larger than that of the model. However, the acquisition of metadata is a difficult and expensive issue. The shortage of data hinders the development of the artificial intelligence industry. At present, because of lack of trust, data abuse and other reasons, individuals are unwilling to contribute data, and business organizations that have need obtain data through unconventional means. Lambda will eventually form an integrated network of huge data storage space, and data owners can sell their data through smart contracts on Lambda's trading platform. In particular, the value of time-series data lies in the insights after the analysis. Data owners do not need to sell the original data, but only sell the analysis results of the data, and even the insights on the results of the data analysis.
